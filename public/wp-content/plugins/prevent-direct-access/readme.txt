== 🤔 Why Every WordPress Site Needs File Protection ==

With cybercrime damages predicted to hit $10.5 trillion by 2025, protecting your digital assets isn't optional - it's essential. Yet WordPress has a massive security hole: uploaded files are publicly accessible by default.

**The Problem:** Upload a "private" document to WordPress, and anyone with the URL can download it. Worse, AI bots and Google can index it, allowing competitors to easily find and steal your work. There's no access control whatsoever.

**The Solution:** PDA transforms WordPress into a secure file vault while maintaining the ease of use you love. Protect files with one click, share secure links with authorized users, and sleep knowing your content is truly private.

---

== ⚡ Features That Make PDA #1 ==

=== 🆓 FREE Forever Features ===

**🛡️ Direct URL Protection**
The core magic of PDA – files become inaccessible via direct URL access, even if someone knows the exact path. Only users with proper permissions can view protected files. Unauthorized visitors get your 404 page instead.

**🎲 Auto-Generated Private Links**
Each protected file gets a unique, unguessable private download link (also known as an expiring link). These links aren't indexed by search engines and are the only way to access protected files. While anyone with the link can access the file, you can set download limits and expiration times — ideal for temporary sharing like marketing campaigns.

**🚫 AI Indexing & Search Engine Blocking**
PDA explicitly tells AI Indexing Scrapers, Google, Bing, and other search engines not to index your protected files. Your private PDFs, documents, and media will never appear in search results. This works at the server level for bulletproof protection.

**🖼️ Image Hotlink Prevention**
Stop other sites from stealing your bandwidth by embedding your images. When enabled, images can only be displayed on your domain. This feature alone can save significant hosting costs for image-heavy sites.

**🗂️ Upload Directory Protection**
Your entire wp-content/uploads folder becomes protected. Directory browsing is disabled, preventing anyone from seeing a list of all your uploaded files. A critical security layer most sites miss.

**👤 IP-Based Access Control**
Block specific IP addresses from accessing your private links. Perfect for preventing access from problematic users or regions.

**👥 File Author Permissions**
By default, file authors and admins can always access protected files directly. This ensures content creators maintain access to their uploads while blocking everyone else.

**📊 Media Library Integration**
PDA adds a dedicated column to your Media Library list view. See protection status at a glance, configure settings without leaving the media screen, and manage hundreds of files efficiently.


=== 💎 GOLD Power Features ===

**🔗 [Automatic URL Replacement (Exclusive to PDA Gold)](https://preventdirectaccess.com/docs/replace-unprotected-urls-in-wordpress-content/)**
This game-changing feature automatically finds and replaces unprotected file URLs already embedded in your posts and pages. No manual updating needed – PDA handles everything in the background. When you protect a file, every instance across your site updates instantly.

**👤 [IP-Based Access Control](https://preventdirectaccess.com/docs/restrict-wordpress-access-ip-address/)**
Aside from blocking IP addresses from accessing private links, you can also whitelist IPs at different levels:
- Global level
- File level
- Entire site

**📁 [One-Click Folder Protection](https://preventdirectaccess.com/docs/restrict-wordpress-access-ip-address/)**
Protect entire folders without manually updating individual files. Simply specify a folder path and all current and future files inside are automatically secured. Perfect for:
- Course materials organized by module
- Client project folders
- Monthly content archives
- Departmental documents

**🧙‍♂️ [Private Magic Links](https://preventdirectaccess.com/docs/how-to-use-private-magic-links/)**
An upgrade from standard private links, Private Magic Links let you control who can access your files — just like protected links. Perfect for:
- Portfolio previews
- Document review without distribution
- Temporary access for contractors
- Preview-before-purchase scenarios

Even when set to "anyone," Magic Links can expire just 1 second after page load, ideal for view-only access — preventing sharing or reuse. Once expired, refreshing the page auto-generates a new link for seamless access.

**🔐 [Shared Private Links](https://preventdirectaccess.com/docs/shared-private-links/)**
Create a single download link that tracks usage per logged-in user. Features:
- Individual download limits per user
- Detailed usage analytics
- Perfect for licensed content
- Prevents password sharing abuse

**☁️ [Amazon S3 Integration](https://preventdirectaccess.com/docs/how-to-use-prevent-direct-access-s3/)**
Extend PDA protection to cloud storage. Features:
- Protect S3-hosted files
- Generate expiring S3 URLs
- Sync local and cloud protection
- Search & replace S3 URLs in content
- Multi-bucket support
- Wasabi storage compatible

**🛒 [Advanced WooCommerce Integration](https://preventdirectaccess.com/extensions/woocommerce-integration/)**
Transform WooCommerce into a digital content powerhouse:
- IP restrictions for order pages – Prevent order sharing
- Time-limited download access – Set expiration after purchase
- Product-specific file protection – Different rules per product
- Download attempt tracking – Monitor usage patterns
- Reset download limit and expiry of WooCommerce "parent" products

**👤 Custom Role Integration**

- Custom role selection – Use roles from any plugin
- Bulk permission updates – Change access for hundreds of files at once
- Role-based folders – Auto-assign permissions based on upload location

**🔍 [Advanced Access Restrictions](https://preventdirectaccess.com/extensions/access-restriction/)**
The AR Extension adds enterprise-grade control:
- Geographic restrictions – Limit access by country
- Referrer requirements – Must come from specific sites
- Custom access rules – Build complex permission logic

**🚀 Performance Features**

Prevent Direct Access - Because "private" should mean PRIVATE 🔒

==  Frequently Asked Questions ==

= ❓ What's the difference between file protection and password protection? =
File protection (PDA) secures actual files in your Media Library from direct URL access.  
Password protection (like PPWP) protects pages/posts content. For complete security, many sites use both.

= ❓ Will this break my existing content? =
No! PDA's Smart URL Replacement automatically updates all embedded file links across your site.  
Your content continues working seamlessly while files become protected.

= ❓ What about caching plugins? =
PDA works with all major caching plugins.  
Protected files bypass cache automatically while your pages stay fast.

= ❓ Can I protect files already on my site? =
Yes! PDA works with existing files.  
Just click protect and all embedded links update automatically.  
You can also bulk protect hundreds of files at once.

= ❓ Does it work with page builders? =
Absolutely! The automatic URL replacement works with Elementor, Divi, Beaver Builder, and all other builders.  
No manual updates needed.

= ❓ What happens if I deactivate the plugin? =
We include a safe deactivation process that can restore original URLs if needed.  
Your files won't disappear, but they'll no longer be protected.

= ❓ Is there a file size limit? =
No limits!  
Protect tiny images or massive video files. PDA handles all file sizes efficiently.

= ❓ How is support? =
Exceptional!  
With 286+ five-star reviews, our support is consistently praised.  
Free users get WordPress.org forum support, Gold users get priority email support.

== Screenshots ==
1. Once you have installed the plugin, click Activate
2. Go to Media to protect your files. Prevent Direct Access works best on List View.
3. There’s an extra column called "Prevent Direct Access" auto-generated by our plugin. Click on "Configure file protection" and start protecting your private file.
4. Click on "Protect this file" button to make the file private.
5. The file is now "protected". Its File Access Permission is set to "The file's author", which means it's accessible to the file's author only. Other users are able to access your protected file using a private download link.
6. You can also protect your file under Media Grid View.
7. There’s an extra “Prevent Direct Access” option generated by our plugin under Attachment Details. Check the “Protect this file” box to protect your file.
8. Once your file is protected, it’ll have a red border.
